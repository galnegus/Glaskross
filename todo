!!! TODO !!!

OLD LIST:
 - Cool grafix for bouncer sword, + make bouncer rotate one side towards next wall
 - Make floor performance good, maybe using newImage (see lib/gradient.lua)
 - Sword has 3 layers, each hit removes one layer, when all layers removed, cooldown is removed
 - Remove "hold down to attack"
 - Make an enemy that moves according to a mathematical function, taking the parameters (playerPos, enemyPos, ...)
 - Make an enemy that moves x pixels, briefly stops and then splits in two clones, each moving in a slightly different direction, one clone is an "original" which also splits after x pixels, the other self-destructs are the same distance. So to kill the enemy you'd have to target the "original", killing the "fake" does nothing to stop the chain.
 - Fix BoxyBackgroundComponent so that it is size-agnostic

16/2 -15
 - Add new enemy "seeker", a suicide bomber who moves at a somewhat slow speed, towards the player, turns slowly, small in size, big in numbers
 - Write a spawner for the seeker, preferably using PatternChainer.lua, it should be randomized, spawning a seeker at a pseudo-random position away from teh player
 - HEALTH BAR FEATURES:
 	- Lose a chunk of hp when taking damage
 	- Gain a chunk of hp when killing an enemy
 - Integrate health into the main game somehow, use the HPComponent! Lots of signals and shit.
 	- Make Entities:getAll(entityType) to enable retrieving player in HealthBar.lua which then stores that locally

30/7 -16
 - Change bullet so that it's more like a short range spear that you throw, keep same movement behaviour
 - Add a blink mechanic, hitting space teleports you a short distance forward. The direction is determined by the velocity vector and the rotation. Find the rotation closest perpendicular side of the square to the velocity vector and use that as the direciton. Very short cooldown, make some cool visual particle effect at the spot you blinked from.
 - LEVELS:
  - 1.1 simon says, four squares that lights up one by one, when you hit the one that's lit, the next one goes, but on a timer, you have to hit them in quick succession or else start over from the beginning, impossible without blink.
  - 1.2 boss made up of blocks, some blocks will light up, specifics unknown. ideas: i. blocks in front and behind alternate for a phase. ii. maybe some bullet hell attacks from boss, but the only way to avoid is to go up close dark souls style.
  - 2.1 tetris, blocks fall from sky you have to sculpt them to make sure they fall correctly.
  - 2.2 ---

DONE:

 - Make bouncer move slighly towards player
 + Add a CollisionRules.lua containing static methods that are reused by all physics components.
 	+ Consider replacing the ".type" of collision bodies from EntityTypes to BodyTypes, i.e. adding new BodyTypes like "player", "playerweapon", "enemy", "enemyweapon"
 	+ Possibly by having each physics component receive a list of rules to consider in its contructor.
